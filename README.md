# bluesky-pds-cdk

This repository contains an AWS CDK template for self-hosting a
[Bluesky Personal Data Server (PDS)](https://atproto.com/guides/self-hosting) on AWS.

## Architecture

  end

  C --> E("Blob store

  D --> F("Database backup
  S3 bucket")
```

This architecture was designed with resiliency in mind.
A single [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) task sits behind a load balancer
that spans two AZs, running in its own VPC.
The load balancer terminates TLS, and redirects HTTP to HTTPS.
[Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) ensures that only one task
is running at a time. In case of an unhealthy task, ECS will terminate the task and
start a new one in either of the two AZs.

The Fargate task runs two containers:
1. The main **PDS container**, using the
[official PDS Docker image](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds/pkgs/container/pds).
The official image is hosted on GitHub's Container Registry, but it is pulled from an
[Amazon ECR pull-through cache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache.html).
The PDS uses an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket for its blob store.
It also uses [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
to generate and store its admin password and JWT secret key,
and [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) for its PLC rotation key.
2. A **sidecar container** that uses [Litestream](https://litestream.io/)
to continuously replicate the PDS on-disk SQLite databases to S3.
On task launch, the sidecar starts before the PDS and restores the database files
from S3 to the local disk.

For monitoring, container logs are sent to [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).
Alarms are configured in CloudWatch on load balancer metrics.
